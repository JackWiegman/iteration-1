C          Am7
Thereâ€™s a feeling I get,
           Am
When I look to the West.
            C           G               Am
And my spirit is crying for leaving.
            C                   Am7
In my thoughts I have seen,
                Am
Rings of smoke through the trees,
                C         G                     Am
And the voices of those who stand looking.
